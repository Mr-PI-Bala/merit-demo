**Introductory tutorial for new Content Creators**  
**Tagline:** Build your app over dinner; let MERIT publicize and promote you overnight.

| **Audience** | Non-technical creators — no prior MERIT, GitHub, or cloud setup |
| **You need tonight** | A laptop, internet, two public downloads |

## Introduction

MERIT gives you a **ready-made app** (Journal, AMA, subscriber pages) plus **free tools** to personalize it. You do the creative work in one evening. MERIT’s discovery platform finds your audience overnight.

This document is the **only** guide you need for night one. Technical permutations (deploy, commerce, operator tiers) are in the [Advanced section](#advanced-optional) at the end.

### The idea in three steps

| Step | What you do | Accounts |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **1** | Download **merit-agent-skills** (tools) and **merit-demo** (app shell) | None |
| **2** | Personalize name, story, and Topics of Interest; preview on your laptop | None |
| **3** | Register as Content Creator; submit one ToI pack; pick Journal or AMA for free overnight promotion | Free email signup |

---

## Step 1 — Download the toolkit and the app

Use any folder (example: `C:\MyMeritApp`). You are **not** connecting this laptop to any existing MERIT operator setup.

### 1A — merit-agent-skills

Tools, `merit-live` CLI, and optional Cursor agent skills.

```powershell
mkdir C:\MyMeritApp
cd C:\MyMeritApp
git clone --branch skills-v0.3.5 https://github.com/AgentDraven/merit-agent-skills.git
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/MyMeritApp
cd ~/MyMeritApp
git clone --branch skills-v0.3.5 https://github.com/AgentDraven/merit-agent-skills.git
```

### 1B — merit-demo

Pre-scaffolded application: Journal, AMA, portal pages, legal templates, subscriber funnel cfg.

```powershell
cd C:\MyMeritApp
git clone https://github.com/Mr-PI-Bala/merit-demo.git
```

### GitHub account?

**Not required.** Public `git clone` works without logging in. You only need a GitHub account later if you **fork** or **push** your own copy.

### Optional — Cursor skills

If you use [Cursor](https://cursor.com):

```powershell
cd C:\MyMeritApp\merit-agent-skills
.\install.ps1 -Target Cursor
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
cd ~/MyMeritApp/merit-agent-skills
./install.sh -Target Cursor
```

Open the `merit-demo` folder in Cursor and ask it to help edit branding or portal text.

**Step 1 complete.** Two folders on disk. No cloud accounts.

---

## Step 2 — Make it yours over dinner

Customize what visitors will see. You are **not** putting the app on the internet yet.

### 2A — Product name

File: `merit-demo\cfg\branding.json`  
Change `"product_name"`:

```json
"product_name": "Sunset Reflections"
```

### 2B — Welcome story

Folder: `merit-demo\portal\`  
Edit `index.html` (and optionally `portal/journal/`, `portal/ama/`) with your headline and one short paragraph.

If you use Cursor:

> Update my main portal page for a journal about mindful parenting. Keep the MERIT layout.

### 2C — Topics of Interest (ToI)

Create `merit-demo\MyTopics.txt` — one topic per line, 3–5 lines:

```text
Mindful parenting
Evening reflection habits
Community Q&A for new parents
```

Each line can become **one ToI pack** in Step 3. Night one uses **one pack only**.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **ToI** | Topics of Interest — what you want to be known for |
| **ToI pack** | One topic written up for MERIT discovery (who you help, tone, promise) |

### 2D — Preview locally

Double-click `merit-demo\play\index.html` in your browser.  
Widgets load from MERIT’s public package CDN — no account.

Optional (Node.js installed):

```powershell
cd C:\MyMeritApp\merit-demo
npm install
npm run verify
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
cd ~/MyMeritApp/merit-demo
npm install
npm run verify
```

**Step 2 complete.** Named product, your words, topic list, local preview. Still no Vercel, Supabase, or Square.

---

## Step 3 — Register; MERIT promotes you overnight

Join as **Content Creator (CC)** on the MERIT platform. Submit **one ToI pack** from your list. Choose **one free surface** (Journal or AMA). MERIT runs discovery while you sleep.

### Overnight flow

```text
Free CC registration
  → you enter one ToI pack (one interest area)
  → Chain of Content (CoC) runs overnight
  → DIRT matches your topic to readers
  → guests land on your Journal or AMA (merit-demo shell)
  → free followers first; paid Plus only when you opt in later
```

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **CC** | Content Creator — you |
| **CoC** | Chain of Content — Topics → Areas → Content → Queue → publish |
| **DIRT** | MERIT discovery engine — finds audience for your ToI |

### 3A — Free registration

1. Open the creator registration URL for your assigned **consumer id** (MERIT operator provides this after onboarding).
2. Sign up with email — **Content Creator** tier (free).
3. No Square, Supabase, or Vercel for this step.

**Pattern example** (canonical demo, not your app):

`https://meritstore.vercel.app/merit-demo/register`

**Your URL** (after MERIT assigns your id):

`https://meritstore.vercel.app/YOUR_ID/register`

### 3B — Submit one ToI pack

1. Choose **one** line from `MyTopics.txt`.
2. Complete the short prompts: what you teach, who you help, your voice.
3. Submit as **one ToI pack** → one **interest area** on the platform.

More packs can be added later. Night one: **one pack → one platform surface**.

### 3C — Pick one free surface

| Surface | Visitor experience |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Journal** | Daily entries; freemium daily cap; upgrade path later |
| **AMA** | Ask-me-anything; voting; freemium caps |

Both are already in merit-demo. Most creators start with **Journal** or **AMA**.

### 3D — Morning

- DIRT routes interested readers to your topic.
- merit-demo is the **face** they see.
- **Guests** and **free subscribers** arrive first.
- **Plus** paid tier and **payouts** require separate setup (see below).

**Step 3 complete.** Registered CC with one live topic lane.

## What MERIT hosts vs what you set up later

### MERIT runs for you (no account on night one)

| Piece | What it does |
|-------|----------------|
| **PAR CDN** | Free UI widgets (`merit_workbench`, `journal`) on `/play/` |
| **meritstore** (platform) | Registration and checkout UI for provisioned creators |
| **DIRT + CoC** | Overnight discovery and routing for your ToI |
| **Free guest tier** | Visitors use Journal/AMA with daily freemium caps |

### You set up only when needed (lazy accounts)

| Account | When you actually need it |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Vercel** | Your own live URL (`you.vercel.app`) |
| **here.now** | Marketing pages (`you.here.now`) |
| **Supabase** | Journal/AMA data saved in **your** cloud database on **your** deploy |
| **Square** | Plus subscription money paid out to **your** bank |

**Important:** MERIT does **not** hide Supabase forever. The platform hosts **widgets and registration**; **your** deployed app uses **your** Supabase for persistent data. Square connects only when you sell Plus and complete payment-provider onboarding (KYC as required by the provider).

### Money and payouts

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|----------------|
| Clone + personalize | No revenue; no payout account |
| Free CC + overnight push | Free guests and subscribers; no creator payout |
| Plus sales (later) | Subscriber pays via meritstore checkout (Square on platform) |
| Creator payout (later) | After meritstore **tenant provision** + **payment provider** link for your consumer id |

Cloning OSS does **not** open a bank account. Revenue from existing demos (e.g. `merit-demo`) flows through those tenants until **your** tenant is provisioned.

## Accounts — quick reference

| Service | Required for Steps 1–3? |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Git CLI | Yes (install only) |
| GitHub login | **No** (unless fork/push) |
| PAR CDN | **No** — public |
| Vercel | **No** until live deploy |
| here.now | **No** until marketing publish |
| Supabase | **No** until cloud journal/AMA |
| Square | **No** until Plus payouts |

---

## FAQ

**Can I skip merit-agent-skills and only use merit-demo?**  
Yes for preview. Keep merit-agent-skills for `merit-live` helpers and Cursor skills when you personalize or deploy.

**Do I need all of here.now, Vercel, and Supabase?**  
No. Each unlocks a different surface. Steps 1–3 need none of them.

**Does MERIT run Supabase and Square for me in the background?**  
PAR and platform registration are hosted by MERIT. Supabase is **your** database when you go live. Square is for **checkout and payout** when you enable Plus — not on night one.

**When do I get paid?**  
After meritstore tenant provision and payment-provider onboarding for your consumer id — not from cloning alone.
